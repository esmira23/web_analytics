Porcupine Tree is unquestionably one of the most difficult-to-categorize and innovative rock bands of all time. The band was formed by musician Steven Wilson in 1987, and began essentially as a solo project for Wilson, who created all of the music. By December 1993, Wilson desired to work in a band environment, and so brought on frequent collaborators. The band has been on hiatus since 2010.

r/Slowcooking is a food-related subreddit for sharing ideas, recipes or pictures in which a ""slow cooker"" was used in the preparation of meals.

Many people think a slow cooker is named a ""crock-pot,"" however this is a trademarked name of just one manufacturer.

Slow cooking is an ideal method for cooking less expensive portions of meat to make them more tender and tasty than by other forms of cookery.

Vegetarian and vegan dishes can also be made via slow cooking.

Who emerged to find Jesus. Who was written off as a has-been by the end of the '80s and who suddenly shifted gears, releasing some of the strongest music of his career beginning in the late '90s.

Ladies and gentlemen — Columbia recording artist Bob Dylan!

This isn’t the area for posting digital Easter eggs, as in screenshots or photographs of screens (games, computer software, TV series, DVD menus); as those are regular Easter eggs and not IRL Easter eggs. Try /r/EasterEggs for such things.

**This sub is for malapropisms.**

A [malapropism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Malapropism) is the mistaken use of a **real, dictionary-defined** incorrect word in place of a **real, dictionary-defined**, similar-sounding word, resulting in a nonsensical, sometimes humorous utterance. An example from baseball player Yogi Berra: ""Texas has a lot of electrical votes"", rather than ""electoral votes.""
